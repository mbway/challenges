# Interesting Things Learnt #
- 01: usage of `None` and `Some`
- 04: tail recursion
- 05: accumulation is backwards, ie. By pre-appending to the accumulator while traversing though a list it reverses the list
- 07: first tricky use of `type` including pattern matching. Use of (pattern as name) to pattern match components while keeping the whole.
- 08: using (... as ...) to group parts of a pattern matched argument
